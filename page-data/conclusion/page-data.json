If you followed everything in this course I would definitely put you in the top 50% of developers who use the shell. Many developers never bother to get this level of depth so for that I want to pat you on the back for taking the time to invest into your tools.</p>\n<p>And guess what? Most of what you learned applies outside of just bash and Ubuntu. Nearly everything I taught you will work literally the same in other shells like zsh (the now-default shell for macOS.) I'd say more than half works as-is for Microsoft PowerShell (installed on Windows by default and works on Linux and macOS too.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-to-go-from-here\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#where-to-go-from-here\" aria-label=\"where to go from here permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Where to go from here</h2>\n<p>This course is a cursory looking into the bash but there are many directions to go from here.
