But it is there and you can use it. It's from Debian, the upstream for Ubuntu, and it's generally a lower level tool for more fine grained control at the cost of being a lot more difficult to use. I never use it.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/what-is-package-management","title":"What is Package Management","order":"8A","section":"Package Management","description":"One of the best part of Linux is its infinite ocean of useful packages.
